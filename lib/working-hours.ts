// Shared helpers for interpreting a BranchStaff member's weekly working-hours
// schedule and deciding whether a given attendance scan is Late / Left Early.
//
// The schedule is stored in BranchStaff.workingHours as JSON:
//   { Mon: { start: "09:00", end: "18:00" } | null, ..., Sun: ... }
// A `null` day means "not a working day". A missing/empty object means the
// employee has no schedule configured yet.
//
// Rules (confirmed with product):
//   • Late        → clock-in is more than 1 minute after the scheduled start.
//   • On Time     → clock-in within the 1-minute grace window.
//   • Left Early  → clock-out is before the scheduled end.
//   • Clocked Out → clock-out is at or after the scheduled end (any time past).
//   • null        → no scheduled hours for that day (a non-working day, or the
//                   employee has no schedule at all). The UI shows no badge.
//
// Leave (AL / MC / etc) is a separate dimension handled by the caller: if an
// employee is on leave for a date, the UI shows the leave-type badge instead of
// any of the statuses below.
