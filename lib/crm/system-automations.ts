/**
 * Catalogue of "built-in" / system automations.
 *
 * These are hard-coded flows that run inside the CRM regardless of whether
 * a super-admin created a matching user automation row. Examples: the lead
 * ingestion pipeline (Wix / Meta / TikTok webhooks → master_leads_base →
 * worker → crm_contact + crm_opportunity), the side-effects of stage moves
 * (CT → create appointment, ENR → set enrolledPackage), and the new-branch
 * auto-pipeline creator.
 *
 * This file is documentation-as-data — it surfaces what's happening in
 * code so super-admins can see the full automation surface area on the
 * /crm/automations page. It does NOT execute anything: editing this list
 * doesn't change any behaviour. Behaviour lives in the linked source
 * files. When you change a system automation, update the entry here too.
